# ExperimentGrammar
An experimental test language I am working on.</br>
Just something I am doing in my spare time.
First goal is to get it working.
I'm using ANTLR 4 to define the grammar.
There's going to be a lot that can be improved on, I'm reading and learning as I am going.
A language run on the JVM.

```
var a=3; var b=3; a+7;
a+9;

for 1 to 100 do
{
var a=3;
if x<2 then{
var c=4;
}
}
