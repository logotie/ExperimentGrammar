3 Arraylists:

We process each block one by one.
We have to make sure to start with the first block.
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THERE IS A BLOCK WITHIN A BLOCK.
We walk the block through the Enginelistener.
There's a trigger in the engine listener.
Commands with more than 1 child are treated as grouped commands/levels, they are added to a queue for evaluating later.

These commands are seperated based on their type
ASSIGNMENTS - DONE
ARITHMETIC - DONE
IF - TBD
FOR - TBD

Commands with 1 child are treated as terminals.
We now grab the first command on the stack - which is the lowest level.
Two different paths, coldstart and warmstart
We keep a counter in the engine to signify first execution

COLDSTART -
ARITHMETIC
Pop the lowest instruction off the stack.
We get all the children in the instruction.
The children with length of 1, get their hashcode
