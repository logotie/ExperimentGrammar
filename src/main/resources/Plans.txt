3 Arraylists:

We process each block one by one.
We have to make sure to start with the first block.
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THERE IS A BLOCK WITHIN A BLOCK.
We walk the block through the Enginelistener.
There's a trigger in the engine listener.
Commands with more than 1 child are treated as grouped commands/levels, they are added to a queue for evaluating later.

These commands are seperated based on their type
ASSIGNMENTS - DONE
ARITHMETIC - DONE
IF - TBD
FOR - TBD

Commands with 1 child are treated as terminals.
We now grab the first command on the stack - which is the lowest level.
Two different paths, coldstart and warmstart
We keep a counter in the engine to signify first execution

COLDSTART -
ARITHMETIC : -+/*
Pop the lowest instruction off the stack.
We get all the children in the instruction.
The children with length of 1, get their hashcode
Retrieve them from terminals, using hashcode.
Pass the terminals in specific order with operation.
Get back result object.
Store result object with hashcode of expr in solved.
Throw rest away.

WARMSTART -- Only runs when counter greater than 0
Arithmetic: +-/*
Pop an instruction.
Get all children in the instruction.
Those with children greater than 1
Get hashcode.
Check in solved.
Get result object.
Those with children equals 1 , get hashcode, get value from terminals
Pass terminals in specific order with operation.
Get back result object.
Store result obj with hashcode of expr in solved.
Throw rest away.
